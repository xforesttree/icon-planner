## Icon-planner

A digital equivalent of a physical planning board I have at home. Keep track of your upcoming events with a casual list.
Assign each event an Icon, a name, and a date and watch them sort themselves chronologically and disappear once passed.

## To run

Execute the following commands (or use npm):

`yarn install`
`yarn start`

This is app can be ran on any port, simply change it by using:

`yarn start -p PORTNUMBER`
